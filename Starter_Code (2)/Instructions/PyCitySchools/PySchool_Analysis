According to the calculations done in the PySchool analysis, Charter schools showed higher average math and reading scores while also boasting a higher percentage of students with passing grades in both courses.

Another conclusion we can draw from the data would be that small and medium schools share very similar overall passing rates in math and reading where large schools aren't nearly as successful. It would be safe to assume that schools with more than 2000 total students are not as successful as their smaller counterparts.

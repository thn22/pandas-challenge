### Description of the Project
In this project I was tasked to look at data from the schools within this city's district. The goal was to analyze district wide standardized test results and information about each school. From there, the task was to aggregate the data and pointout trends based on each school's performance.

### Languages and Libraries
This project used Pandas and Jupyter Notebook

### Analysis and Discussion
For this assignment we were to draw two correct conclusions based on the data we generated. My conclusions are:

1. According to the calculations done in the PySchool analysis, Charter schools showed higher average math and reading scores while also boasting a higher percentage of students with passing grades in both courses.

2. Another conclusion we can draw from the data would be that small and medium schools share very similar overall passing rates in math and reading where large schools aren't nearly as successful. It would be safe to assume that schools with more than 2000 total students are not as successful as their smaller counterparts.
